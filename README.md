# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

## Description:

Brain Tumor Classification from Mutlisequence MRI (T1, T1C and T2) and Mutlimodal CT and MRI using EfficientNetV2B0 with Mutliheaded Self Attention and Hyperparameter Fine-Tuning

> Methodology

- Implementation of a novel framework for classifying various kinds of brain tumors and healthy patients from structural MRI scans of T1, T1C and T2 sequences as well CT scans.
- In the first stage, a pre-trained EfficientNetV2 architecture has been used followed by Mutli-Head Self Attention Mechanism on the extracted, high-dimensional sequential feature maps.
- Global Average Pooling, Batch Normalization, L1, L2 Regularization and Dropout along with fine-tuned hyperparameters have been applied before mutli-class classification through softmax activation function.
